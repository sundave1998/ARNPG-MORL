## **Anchor-Changing Regularized Natural Policy Gradient for Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning**
[*Code for ''Anchor-Changing Regularized Natural Policy Gradient for Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning'' (NeurIPS 2022)*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05357)


### Prerequisites
Here we list our running environment:
- PyTorch == 1.10.0
- docplex == 2.18.200
- numpy == 1.19.2
- gym == 0.21.0
- matplotlib == 3.4.3


### Tasks
We implement our proposed ARNPG algorithms in the following environments:
- Tabular MDP (oracle)
- Tabular MDP (sample-based)
- Acrobot-v1
- Hopper-v3


### Execution
To run the experiments, simply execute the following commands, where ''xxx'' corresponds to the name of files.
```
python xxx.py
```
